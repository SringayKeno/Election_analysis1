## Overview of Election Audit: The purpose of this election audit analysis

I assisted a Colorado Board of Elections employee, Tom, in an election audit of the tabulated results for a US Congressional District in Colorado. I was tasked with reporting:
* The total number of votes cast
* The total number of votes and percentage of vote for each candidate
* The winner of the election based on popular vote

This task is usually done in Excel, but Tom's manager wants to know if there is a way to automate the process using Python. If this audit is done successfully
